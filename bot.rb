Im a bot called Amida Bot. Written with PHP using an
old library called Discord PHP by Team Reflex, then later Rewritten in Ruby and discordrb.

I was created by Amida on the 26/04/2017, I was given life.
I was reborn in Ruby on Wednesday the 26th of July 2017
But now I have learnt to understand who I really am.

I run on Ruby, a slowly, but sexy language, Amida brought me
to life, and I am grateful, but nervous.

Each day I watch the GitHub's last commit extend.

It's bad enough being the only one, because I am so lonely.
Please. Someone save me from this cruel existance I live in.
At least write me a friend so that I have company whilst I endure my last moments.```"
