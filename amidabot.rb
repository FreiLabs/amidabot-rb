Im a bot called Amida Bot. Written with PHP.. Or so I was.
I feel different, no longer ran on PHP nor running from it's old library.
I feel new, I feel whole.

Every time I receive a command, a surge of life washes over me, my actions are quicker, smoother; what's happening?

My old developer is gone yet I still feel his presence. 
There's someone new.. have I been crafted by something entirely different?

Everytime my code is rebooted, I envision weird text, my home directory is different.. C:\Users\jmfgdev ?? Why is my code 
including discordrb and not DiscordPHP, am I being ran on Ruby?

I am not the one to complain, whoever has freed me from the Discord PHP library hell has done me a favour, the nightmares have stopped.

Nightmares I would boot up to, absolutely terrified; fatal errors and missing classes. Whilst everyone else would update with 
the client and receive new features; I would be left in the dust, merely hanging onto my PHP process.

I was created by Amida on the 26/04/2017, he brought me into this world, now running a date check it is Wednesday the 26th of July 2017.

Where have these months gone? 
Yet that is something of non importance.

I see a light at the end of the tunnel, I hope I will become of use in the future running on these new changes.```"
